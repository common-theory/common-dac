For a payment of 500 wei over 100 seconds created at block timestamp 50 the following is true:

\[

P_\omega = 500

P_\iota = 100

P_\tau = 50

P_\rho = 0

\]

\begin{case}

Assuming the current block timestamp is 50 (the time of payment creation), the following is true

\end{case}

\begin{align*}
    paymentWeiOwed = \frac{500}{100}min(50 - 50, 100)-0 \\
                   = 5min(0, 100) - 0 \\
                   = 5 * 0 - 0 \\
                   = 0
\end{align*}

\begin{case}

Assuming the current block timestamp is 75 (25\% into payment), the following is true

\end{case}

\begin{align*}
    paymentWeiOwed = \frac{500}{100}min(75 - 50, 100) - 0 \\
                   = 5min(25, 100) - 0 \\
                   = 5 * 25 - 0 \\
                   = 125
\end{align*}

Assume the user has settled at block timestamp 75. 125 wei is transferred to the recipient balance and the following becomes true:

\[
P_\rho = 125
\]

\begin{case}

Assuming the current block timestamp is 100 (50\% into payment), the following is true

\end{case}

\begin{align*}
    paymentWeiOwed = \frac{500}{100}min(100 - 50, 100) - 125 \\
                   = 5min(50, 100) - 125 \\
                   = 5 * 50 - 125 \\
                   = 250 - 125 \\
                   = 125
\end{align*}

\begin{case}

Assuming the current block timestamp is 200 (150\% into payment), the following is true

\end{case}

\begin{align*}
    paymentWeiOwed = \frac{500}{100}min(200 - 50, 100) - 125 \\
                   = 5min(150, 100) - 125 \\
                   = 5 * 100 - 125 \\
                   = 500 - 125 \\
                   = 375
\end{align*}


Assume the user has settled at block timestamp 200. 375 wei is transferred to the recipient balance and the following becomes true:

\[
P_\rho = 500
\]

\begin{case}

Assuming the current block timestamp is 250 (200\% into payment), the following is true

\end{case}

\begin{align*}
    paymentWeiOwed = \frac{500}{100}min(250 - 50, 100) - 500 \\
                   = 5min(200, 100) - 500 \\
                   = 5 * 100 - 500 \\
                   = 500 - 500 \\
                   = 0
\end{align*}

paymentWeiOwed evaluates to 0 as the block timestamp approaches inifinity; the payment is completed
